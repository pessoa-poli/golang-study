Concurrency is a Model For Software Construction - Rob Pike
Concurrency is the composition of independently executing computations. 
Concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once, and parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once.
Concurrency is a way of structuring things so that mayber with parallelism you could do a better job, but parallelism is not the goal of concurrency.
Concurrency's goal is a good structure.
